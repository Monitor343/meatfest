												<h2>Participate in the Festival Of Meat!</h2>
												<p>Anyone is free and encouraged in participating in the Festival of Meat!.</p>

												<h2>Craft your own Meat Creation!</h2>
												<p>Anyone who wants to take on a meat project to share with the festival is more than welcome to. I would love for you to join me in the morning to smoke/cook some fantastic meat while we talk shop.</p>
												<span class="image featured"><img src="images/PXL_20231014_104255415.NIGHT-Small.jpg" alt="" /></span>
												<p>Anyone who would like to participate is welcome to bring thier grill/smoker/pit to my place so we can cook together. If you are interested in this, I can facilitate the transport of your grill/smoker/pit to my house for the day. Feel free to reachout to me using the form at the bottom of this page and we can get somthing planned.</p>

												<h2>Assist with Food Preperation</h2>
												<p>Getting everything ready for all the great people can be quite a task. We welcome anyone who wants to come early and assist with any other food and event prep.</p>

												<h2>A Little Thank You</h2>
												<p>For anyone who wants to come early to cook or otherwise assist, I will be providing a breakfast of pancakes, bacon, sausages, and OJ as a way to say thank you for your assistance.</p>

												<h2 id="allergies">Allergies</h2>
												<p>There will be attendees who have various food restrictions. Below is a list of allergies that I have been made aware of. For anyone bringing any dish, I ask that you bring a list of the allergen from the list below that are present in your dish.</p>
												<p>Don't feel like you can't bring a dish if it contains one of the allergens below. If you can substitute ingredients to avoid a listed allergens without affecting the dish or creating a bunch of additional work; I am sure those with these allergies will appreciate it.</p>
												<p>The goal is to make it easy for those with these allergies to make informed decissions about what is available to them to eat. I will be making little placards with any present allergens to accompany the dish on the table.</p>

												<li>Grapes</li>
